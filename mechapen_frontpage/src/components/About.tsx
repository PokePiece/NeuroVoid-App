        <p>
          This project was engineered in 2025 to explore micro-scale robotics with elegance, precision, and poetic discipline. The MechaPen software embodies a convergence of Rust’s speed, ROS’s modularity, and human-level finesse in motion articulation.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6">
          Beyond functionality, MechaPen represents a philosophy — that even machinery can reflect intentionality, symmetry, and creativity in its core logic. This is more than robotics. It’s mechanical art.
