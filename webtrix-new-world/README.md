# Webtrix: New World -- Hyper Webspace

> An immersive, physics-enabled 3D environment that seeks to **ground the web into a physical realm**.

Webtrix: New World is a **React Three Fiber** experience where the abstract world of the internet becomes tangible. Users explore a procedurally generated floating world populated with interactive AI assistants, portals, holograms, and more â€” all rendered in real time in the browser.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Immersive 3D Scene**  
  Powered by `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei`, with realistic lighting, shadows, and physics.

- **Procedural World Generation**  
  The floating islands are assembled into chunks, each containing a combination of terrain, vegetation, buildings, and interactive elements.

- **Player Controller**  
  - WASD movement with physics via `@react-three/rapier`.  
  - Jumping and mid-air grappling hook mechanics.  
  - Smooth camera orbit controls.

- **Interactive AI Assistants**  
  Floating orbs that can be clicked to open a chat interface. Conversations combine **local model reasoning** (Pythia-410M) and **cloud reasoning** (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash).

- **Dynamic Objects & Effects**  
  - Waterfalls, grass fields, and paths.  
  - Portals to other locations.  
  - Holographic objects and chat systems.  
  - Floating NPCs and decorative props.

- **Server-Backed AI**  
  Backend built with **FastAPI**, integrating:
  - **Local model inference** via Hugging Face Transformers.
  - **Cloud model reasoning** with Googleâ€™s Generative AI API.
  - Endpoints for `/chat` and `/quest` generation.

## ðŸ•¹ Controls

- **Move**: `W` `A` `S` `D`  
- **Jump**: `Space`  
- **Grapple**: (Depends on `GrapplingHook` implementation)  
- **Click AI Assistant**: Open/close chat window  
- **Orbit camera**: Mouse drag (via OrbitControls)

## ðŸŒŒ Vision
Webtrix: New World is more than a scene â€” it's an experiment in bringing the internet to life as a traversable, physical place.
Imagine if your browser tabs, AI assistants, and digital content werenâ€™t locked behind flat screens, but manifested as objects you could walk up to, talk to, and interact with â€” all in a seamless 3D world.
