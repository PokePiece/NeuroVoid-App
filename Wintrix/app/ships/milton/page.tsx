            PARADISE LOST.
            BOOK I. THE First Book proposes, first in brief, the whole subject, man's disobedience, and the loss thereupon of Paradise,
            wherein he was placed; then touches the prime cause of his fall, the Serpent, or rather Satan iu the Serpentwho, revolting from God, and drawing to his side many legions of angels, was, by the command of God,' driven out of Heaven, with all his crew, into the great deep. Which action passed over, the Poem hastens
            into the midst of things, presenting Satan with his angels now falling into Hell, described here, not in the
            centre,for Heaven and Earth may be supposed as yet not made, certainly not yet accursed, but in a place of utter darkness, fitliest called Chaos. Here Satan, with his anyels, lying on the burning lake, thunderstruck and
            astonished, after a certain cpace recovers, as from confusion, calls up to him who next in order and dignity
            lay by him; they confer of their miserabl. fall; Satan i, wakens all his legions, who lay till then in the same manner confounded. They rise; their numbers; array of battle; their chief leaders named, according to the
            idols known afterward in Canaan and the countries ndjoining. To these Satan directs his speech, comforts them with hope yet of regaining Heaven, but tells them lastly of a new world, and a new kind of creature
            to be created, according to an ancient prophecy, or report in Heaven; for, that imgels were long before this visible creation, was the opinion of many ancient fathers. To find out the truth of this prophecy, and what
            to determine thereon, he refers to a full council. What his associates thence attempt. Pandemonium, the palace of Satan, rises, suddenly built out of the deep: the infernal peers there sit in council.

            'Few things arc so fatal to the pleasant and profitable reading of an author, as the distraction occasioned by
            profuse, and often trivial, notes upon his text. Commentators on Milton have assigned a large space to coincidences between him and preceding wiiters a wonderful larger sp?ce than we should have thought it worth while so to occupy. We doubt not that much the greater part of those coincidences are coincidences of which the author was
            wholly unconscious; and where it was otherwise, the matter is either so trivial as not to deserve to be mentioned, or
            the metal borrowed is borrowed almost invariably that it might receive an impress which the genius of Milton only could have given to it. In the annotation we submit to the reader, we hope to distinguish between what may be
            really useful, and what would be felt as only so much incurabrance and impediment.
            * Sing, heacenly Muse. Prayer for the inspiration breathed into the old Hebrew prophets. Milton's third wife,
            who survived him many years, related ofliim that he used to compose his poetry chiefly in winter; and on his waking
            in a morning would make her write down sometimes twenty or thirty verses. Being asked whether he did not often read Hoiuer and Virgil, she understood the question as indicating a suspicion that he may have made an undue use
            in some instances of those authors, and answered with eagerness "He stole from nobody but the Muse who
            inspired him ; " and beiug asked by a lady present who the Muse was, she replied " It was God's grace, and the Holy Spirit that visited him nightly." NeietmCt Life of Milton. Richardson also says "Milton would sometimes lie awake whole nights, but not a verse could he make ; and on a sudden his poetic fancy would rush upon him
            with an impetus, or festrum."

            Nine times the space that measures day and night
            To mortal men, he with his horrid crew
            Lay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf,
            Confounded, though immortal. But his doom
            lleserved him to more wrath ; for now the thought

            Torments him. Round he throws his baleful eyes,

            Breaking the horrid silence, thus began :
            If thou beest he ; but oh, how fallen ! how changed
            From him, who, in the happy realms of light,
            Clothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine

            In equal ruin ; into what pit thou seest
            From what height fallen, so much the stronger proved
            He with his thunder. And till then who knew
            The force of those dire arms? Yet not for those,
            Nor what the potent Victor in his rage
            Can else inflict, do I repent or change,
            Though changed in outward lustre, that fixed mind,
            And high disdain from sense of injured merit,
            That with the Mightiest raised me to contend,
            And to the fierce contention brought along
            Innumerable force of Spirits armed,

            And what is else not to be overcome ; That glory never shall his wrath or might
            Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace
            With suppliant knee, and deify His power
            Who from the terror of this arm so late
            Doubted his empire that were low indeed,
            That were an ignominy, and shame beneath
            This downfall. Since, by fate, the strength of gods,
            And this empyreal substance, cannot fail ;
            Since, through experience of this great event,
            In arms not worse, in foresight much advanced,
            We may with more successful hope resolve
            To wage, by force or guile, eternal war,
            Irreconcilable to our grand Foe,
            Who now triumphs, and, in the excess of joy
            Sole reigning, holds the tyranny of Heaven.
            So spake the apostate angel, though in pain,
            Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair;
            And him thus answered soon his bold compeer :
            prince, chief of many-throned powers,
            That led the embattled seraphim to war
            Under thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds
            Fearless, endangcr'd heaven's perpetual King,
            And put to proof His high supremacy,
            Whether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate ;
            Too well I see and rue the dire event,
            That with sad overthrow and foul defeat,
            Hath lost us Heaven, and all this mighty host
            In horrible destruction laid thus low,
            As far as gods and heavenly essences
            Can perish: for the inind and spirit remain
            Invincible, and vigour soon returns,
            Though all our glory extinct, and happy state
            Here swallowed up in endless misery.

            Of force believe Almighty since no less
            Thau such could have o'erpowered such force as ours: Have left us this our spirit and strength entire,
            Strongly to suifer and support our pains,
            That we may so suffice
            1 His vengeful ire,
            Or do Him mightier service as His thralls
            2
            By right of war, whate'er His business be,
            Here in the heart of hell to work in fire,
            Or to His errands in the gloomy Deep?
            What can it then avail, though yet we feel
            Strength undiminished, or eternal being,
            To undergo eternal punishment?
            Whereto with speedy words the arch-fiend replied :
            Fallen cherub! to be weak is miserable,
            Doing or suffering : but of this be sure,
            To do aught good never will be our task,
            But ever to do ill our sole delight,
            As being contrary to His high will
            Whom we resist. If then His providence
            Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,
            Our labour must be to pervert that end,
            And out of good still to find means of evil ; Which oft-times may succeed, so as perhaps
            Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb
            His inmost counsels from their destined aim.
            But see ! the angry Victor hath recalled
            His ministers of vengeance and pursuit
            Back to the gates of Heaven. The sulphurous hail,
            Shot after us in storm, o'crblown, hath laid
            The fiery surge, that from the precipice
            Of Heaven received us falling, and the thunder,
            Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage,
            Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now
            To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.

            Let us not slip the occasion, whether scorn,

            Seest thou the dreary plain, forlorn and wild,
            The seat of desolation, void of light,
            Save what the glimmering of these livid flames
            Cast pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend
            From off the tossing of these fiery waves,
            There rest if any rest can harbour there
            And, re-assembling our afflicted powers,
            Consult how we may henceforth most offend
