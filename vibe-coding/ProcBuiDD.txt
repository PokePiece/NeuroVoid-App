Alright — here’s a comprehensive design document for the system you described, so any dev team (or future you) can pick it up and know exactly how to implement it.

Living Internet Structures – Design Document
1. Overview
The goal is to algorithmically generate context-aware 3D building representations of websites, where each structure visually reflects the site's nature, popularity, and category. The system will:

Pull real-world site data (popularity, category, description).

Use an AI-driven mapping layer to translate that data into structured visual parameters.

Render buildings in Three.js / React Three Fiber (R3F) from a library of modular building components.

Scale to thousands of sites dynamically without manual art direction.

Data Fetcher  →  Site Data Normalizer  →  AI Style Generator  →  Building Store  →  R3F Renderer
2.1 Data Fetcher
Sources:

Tranco API (site popularity ranks)

Wikidata API (site categories, descriptions, founding dates)

Custom web scraper (fallback if data missing)

Data Points:

name

url

rank (integer)

category (e.g., "Video Sharing", "News", "E-Commerce")

description (text)

color hints (if available from branding analysis)

2.2 Site Data Normalizer
Normalizes raw API output into:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "YouTube",
  "url": "https://youtube.com",
  "rank": 2,
  "category": "Video Sharing",
  "description": "A popular platform for sharing and watching videos.",
  "brandingColors": ["#ff0000", "#ffffff"]
}
Uses a category map to standardize categories into a finite set:

video

news

ecommerce

social

reference

entertainment

tech

other

3. AI Style Generator
3.1 Prompting
We pass the normalized site data to an AI model (Google Gemini or local LLaMA 70M–410M), along with:

A list of available building components (roofs, walls, extras).

Example mappings from categories to style choices.

Output format specification (strict JSON).

3.2 Example Prompt
css
Copy
Edit
You are a style mapper for an Internet visualization. 
Given the following site data:
{
  "name": "YouTube",
  "rank": 2,
  "category": "video",
  "description": "A popular platform for sharing and watching videos.",
  "brandingColors": ["#ff0000", "#ffffff"]
}
Choose a building configuration using only the provided components.

Components:
Roofs: flat-industrial, gabled-classic, glass-dome, pagoda-tiered, billboard-roof
Walls: glass-panels, red-brick, concrete-brutalist, wooden-facade, neon-frames
Extras: rotating-billboard, news-podium, interactive-fountain, drone-swarm, market-stalls, satellite-dish, data-stream-beam

Return JSON in the format:
{
  "scale": "small|medium|large",
  "roof": { "style": "string", "color": "#hex" },
  "walls": { "style": "string", "color": "#hex" },
  "extras": ["string", "string"]
}
3.3 Example AI Output

{
  "scale": "large",
  "roof": { "style": "billboard-roof", "color": "#ff0000" },
  "walls": { "style": "glass-panels", "color": "#ffffff" },
  "extras": ["rotating-billboard", "data-stream-beam"]
}
4. Building Store (Component Library)
We prebuild all visual parts in R3F (or import GLTFs), stored in a central registry.

export const BuildingStore = {
  roofs: {
    "flat-industrial": <FlatIndustrialRoof />,
    "gabled-classic": <GabledClassicRoof />,
    "glass-dome": <GlassDomeRoof />,
    "pagoda-tiered": <PagodaTieredRoof />,
    "billboard-roof": <BillboardRoof />
  },
  walls: {
    "glass-panels": <GlassPanelsWalls />,
    "red-brick": <RedBrickWalls />,
    "concrete-brutalist": <ConcreteBrutalistWalls />,
    "wooden-facade": <WoodenFacadeWalls />,
    "neon-frames": <NeonFramesWalls />
  },
  extras: {
    "rotating-billboard": <RotatingBillboard />,
    "news-podium": <NewsPodium />,
    "interactive-fountain": <InteractiveFountain />,
    "drone-swarm": <DroneSwarm />,
    "market-stalls": <MarketStalls />,
    "satellite-dish": <SatelliteDish />,
    "data-stream-beam": <DataStreamBeam />
  }
}
5. Renderer
The renderer:

Places buildings in 3D space based on rank → distance mapping.

Uses the AI output to choose components from the Building Store.

Assigns colors and scale dynamically.

6. Scaling Considerations
Component Instancing: Use instanced meshes for repeating geometry.

Lazy Loading: Only render buildings in the camera’s near radius.

Level of Detail (LOD): Simplify geometry at distance.

AI Caching: Store AI results for each site to avoid re-prompting.

7. Future Extensions
Live data hooks (billboards pull real-time tweets, video previews, headlines).

Procedural terrain influenced by site type.

NPC-like agents representing user communities.

Seasonal or event-based styling.

If you want, I can now design the exact category → building style mapping table so the AI doesn’t have to guess from scratch and the world feels more cohesive. That table will make this feel immediately alive.

Do you want me to draft that mapping? That’s the next natural step.
